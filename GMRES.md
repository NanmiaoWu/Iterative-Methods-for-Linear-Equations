Previously, we introduce several iterative algorims to solve the linear equation **Ax = b**,
where **A** is n x n symmetric matrix. What is **A** is non-symmetric matrix? We will introduce the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) to address the issue in the following.

The basic idea of GMRES is to construct the approximate solution ![x_k](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29106484/61744118-245a3980-ad5c-11e9-80c7-157a8c3daca1.png), where ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29106484/61745044-4d7bc980-ad5e-11e9-82a0-b4004d4917aa.png).

Let ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29106484/61745398-1eb22300-ad5f-11e9-81b2-02cc4477e0df.png), where ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29106484/61745672-aac44a80-ad5f-11e9-902c-f665e9e98f52.png) is k x k unitary matrix and can be computed by using Arnoldi iteration.

Recall that our goal is to find the solution that minimizes the residual, shown as follow: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29106484/61746931-68e8d380-ad62-11e9-9f2d-3213051963e8.png).

## Iterative Methods

Suppose we plan to solve the linear equation 
![first equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_black%20%5Clarge%20%5Cmathbf%7BA%7D%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D%20%3D%20%5Cmathbf%7Bb%7D),

where A and b is known, which are n x n symmetric, positive-definite, and real matrix and n x 1 vector, respectively.

One solution is direct method, the process is shown as Fig.1, which is from wiki:

When n is large, direct method would have huge compution cost. Instead, we apply iterative method that enables us to approximately solve it.
